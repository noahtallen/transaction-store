# Transaction Store

This project is a basic server + app for storing and analyzing one's financial transactions.

The initial is to support:

1. Importing your financial transactions from most financial institutions.
2. Quick editing of your transactions to correctly name and categorize them.
3. Basic data analysis of your income and spending.

Beyond that, it would be very cool to support some smarter features:

1. Auto-categorization/naming using machine learning.
2. Smart transaction splitting so that a receipt could be split into multiple categories.
